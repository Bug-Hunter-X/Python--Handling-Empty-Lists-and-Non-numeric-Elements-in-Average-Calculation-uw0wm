This repository contains a simple Python function to calculate the average of a list of numbers. It highlights a common error in such functions â€“ the failure to handle empty lists or lists containing non-numeric elements. The `bug.py` file shows the initial flawed code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a robust solution that addresses these issues using exception handling and type checking.
